James Earl Jones Talking Keyboard

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">James Earl Jones</a> (b. 1930) is a prolific American actor of stage, film, and television with a career spanning over six decades.  Jones is widely known for his trademark sonorous voice.

As a tribute to the actor, I've revised an earlier web creation of mine, <a href="https://ajgabz.github.io/talking-keyboard"> Talking Keyboard</a>, using sound clips of Jones speaking each letter.

In 1969, Jones made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ6WwC174Yc">guest appearance</a> on the then-new show called "Sesame Street," where he eloquently recited the alphabet.  That clip became the basis for the sounds in this web tool.</p>

Neither Mr. Jones nor any of his representatives have any involvement with this project.  Audio footage from Sesame Street (S1, E2) is used under Fair Use Provisions. All rights reserved.</p>
